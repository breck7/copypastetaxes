paragraph
 POOP is the *Programming Option for Overtired Parents*. It
 is a Tree Language for sleep deprived parents to log their
 child's bathroom, feeding, and sleep events. You can use
 POOP with computers or pen and paper. Each line records an
 event, a time, and optionally notes.

paragraph
 POOP is an anyfix language. You can put the time first or
 the event type first. You can write the actual symbols with
 pen or pencil, or, if it is 3am, you can just use some of
 the natural medium to record the event type.
