* At this stage there are more questions than answers.

? What are the main compile targets?

* Another way to ask this questionâ€”what are all the forms that the IRS accepts from citizens that the citizen has to fill out?

* These forms can be thought of as the "compile targets". CopyPasteTaxes will be a Tree Language that "compiles" (aka generates) these final forms.

* These forms may be PDF. Or maybe XML. Or JSON. Or something else. I'm not sure what the IRS accepts. This is something to figure out.

* It will be good to see how many types of forms there are, who files what, and how many are filed each year (and trends).

? What are the supporting forms the IRS accepts?

* These would be things like W2's and 1099's. How many of these types of forms are there?

* How many does the average citizen send in each year?

* My guess is these forms we just need to understand in terms of what fields we'd need to extract for the language for copying into the compile targets.

? What are the checklists?

* Who has made some great checklists on every workflow that can happen with the IRS?

? What are the formulas and business logic?

* This one will probably be a real snoozer. What are the all calcuations necessary to help figure out the right numbers to put in the compile targets?

? How are things different for personal vs business taxes?

* Should CopyPasteTaxes only do personal taxes? What about for self-employed people? It may be hard to only do personal, as that might exclude self-employed people, who may be the ones who most need CopyPasteTaxes.

? How can CopyPasteTaxes generate state tax returns?

* Federal is first, but then how can we make it so we compile to other state level targets as well?

? How can CopyPasteTaxes help with self-employment taxes?

* Should CopyPasteTaxes help with itemized expenses? What would that entail? Would a sub DSL for receipts make sense?

? What are the key dates to be aware of?

* Everyone knows April 15th. What are the other dates to have on the calendar?
