# CopyPasteTaxes

I am trying to do my taxes in TurboTax, and a stupid bug in
their website keeps crashing it. And this is after many hours
of filling in information I should be able to copy/paste once,
many hours of reading about whether or not I qualify for countless
special interest deductions, and many years of doing the same
thing, year after year.

I'm fed up.

And I'm ready to fix it.

## The Plan

Here's the plan.

[] Start the community
[] Build a dumb little working demo
[] Make a screencast
[] Build a stupid version v1.0
[] Launch a $50K crowdfunding campaign to see if people care
