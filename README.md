# CopyPasteTaxes

Your taxes should be a single text file that is easy
to read. Filling out your taxes each year should mostly
just be updating a few lines in that text/file, and
copy pasting the whole thing into IRS.gov. Experts who
understand the deductions should be able to provide
snippets that you can copy/paste into your taxes.

The whole thing should take just a few minutes per
year, and you should be able to do it yourself, for
free, if you so choose.

## Origin

It is Saturday morning, I am trying to do my taxes in TurboTax,
and a stupid bug in their website keeps crashing it. And this is
after many hours of filling in information I should be able to
copy/paste once, many hours of reading about whether or not I
qualify for countless special interest deductions, and many years
of doing the same thing, year after year.

I'm fed up.

And I'm ready to fix it.

## The Plan

Here's the plan.

[] Start the community

[] Build a dumb little working demo

[] Make a screencast

[] Build a stupid version v1.0

[] Launch a $50K crowdfunding campaign to see if people care
